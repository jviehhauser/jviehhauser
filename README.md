# Hey 👋 there, I'm Josef.

* M.Sc. (TUM) Information Systems with a strong background in cloud-based data platforms and data science.
* 🚀 I currently work as a Product Owner for the [Cloud Data Hub](https://data.bmwgroup.com) at the BMW Group in Munich, and my team's mission is to organize all of our organization's data and make it universally actionable. 
* 👨‍💻 I lead a full-stack software engineering team composed of fantastic and diverse individuals with a strong builder’s mentality, and my job is to unleash their skills and unite us towards a common vision.

I'm speaking and writing about what my team and me does:
* [All Things Automotive with AWS: BMW Group's Data Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cr2EYp8WgM): Check out my interview with Stefano and Dean from AWS, where I've talked about our team's journey in building up our Cloud Data Hub. TL;DR: It's crazy, how time flies—today, our platform houses more than 2.5 Petabyte and we offer a central catalog for datasets, use cases, and more via our web-based Data Portal. And I'm thrilled to tell you that we'll be open sourcing (bigger parts of) our API, platform, and Data Portal at the end of this year.
* [AWS re:invent 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fH3y5p8ewE): We presented our current state of things when we were in the midst of migrating our on-premises data lake to AWS via a "lift, think, and shift" approach.
* We'll soon publish a paper on data lineage—I'll keep you posted here.

💬 Ask me about our team's experience with building out a data platform at scale—happy to chat.
