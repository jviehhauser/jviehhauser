# Hey ðŸ‘‹ there, I'm Josef.

* M.Sc. (TUM) Information Systems with a track record of leading software engineering teams in the cloud and data space.
* I currently work at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com).
* I previously led the development of BMW Group's [Cloud Data Hub](https://data.bmwgroup.com), in which our mission was to organize all of our organization's data and make it universally actionable. We scaled a full-stack software engineering team composed of 40+ fantastic and diverse individuals with a strong builder's mentality. My primary job was to unleash their skills and unite us towards a shared vision.

I'm speaking and writing about things that spark my interest:
* We recently published a paper on [collecting and visualizing data lineage of Spark jobs](https://www.springerprofessional.de/collecting-and-visualizing-data-lineage-of-spark-jobs/19728032). 
* Check out the interview ["All Things Automotive with AWS: BMW Group's Data Lake"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cr2EYp8WgM) with Stefano and Dean, where I've talked about our journey in building up our Cloud Data Hub. TL;DR: At the end of 2021, our platform housed more than 2.5 Petabytes, and we offered a central catalog for datasets, use cases, and more via a web-based Data Portal. The stack will be open-sourced until the end of Q2/2022.
* We were presenting a few updates for our platform at [AWS reinvent 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGGd-kUaLo) and [AWS reinvent 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fH3y5p8ewE).
